# R-samples
Samples from the code I wrote in R

You can find 3 .R files here that I used to do the data analysis in my last project. They include reading the data, creating some graphs of them, calculating some basic descriptives, building up and visualizing decision trees and finally some linear models. Usually I comment my code so that it is understandable later for me or for anybody else, but these comments here are in Hungarian. Also the variable names. So I can describe in English what I was doing, if it's necessary.
